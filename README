California Classical and Contemporary Art Museum (3CAM) website

This website was the final project for a Web Design and Development course I had taken at my local community college. We were tasked with creating a website for a fictional business of our choosing. Being a lover of art and museums, I chose to base my final project on a fictional museum based in California. This fictional museum was named the California Classical and Contemporary Art Museum (stylized as "3CAM"). Here is an excerpt from the "About Me" section:

"The mission of the California Classical and Contemporary Art Museum is to promote, celebrate, and appreciate Californiaâ€™s people, cultures and unrivaled diversity through art, science, and performance.

3CAM strives to create experiences that help to not only celebrate the lives of Californians, but also those around the world, and in doing so, enrich both. As a place with a sense of diversity like no other, the world serves as not only our inspiration, but as a connection to each of our individual stories as Californians."

I took inspiration from the websites of museums such as the Exploratorium (https://www.exploratorium.edu/) and the Asian Art Museum (https://asianart.org/).

Future Plans: This project only required the use of HTML and CSS, so incorporating JavaScript where appropriate will be the next priority in order to create a more dynamic experience.
